                <h3>Speaker Notes - Slide 1:</h3>
                <p>Reference to VW's famous "Think Small" campaign. We're applying the same contrarian thinking to real estate - while everyone chases new construction, the real opportunity is in overlooked older properties. Just like VW made small cars desirable when everyone wanted big ones, we're making old houses profitable when everyone wants new ones.</p>

                <h3>Speaker Notes - Slide 2:</h3>
                <p>We analyzed 21,597 properties to answer three fundamental questions about real estate investment. This isn't theory - it's data-driven strategy. Every recommendation comes from rigorous analysis of actual market transactions.</p>

                <h3>Speaker Notes - Slide 3:</h3>
                <p>The first question every investor asks. Everyone assumes renovation adds value, but how much? And is it worth the risk and effort? We looked at over 6,000 old properties to find the real answer.</p>

                <h3>Speaker Notes - Slide 4:</h3>
                <p>Renovation doesn't just pay - it pays exceptionally well. Properties 50+ years old that have been renovated command an average premium of $260,066. That's a 52.4% increase in value. The market rewards quality renovation of older properties more than we expected.</p>

                <h3>Speaker Notes - Slide 6:</h3>
                <p>Timing matters more than most realize. Selling during peak months (May-July) versus off-peak months (November-January) yields an average difference of $26,850. That's a 5.1% premium just for timing your exit right. Plan your renovations for winter, sell in summer.</p>

                <h3>Speaker Notes - Slide 8:</h3>
                <p>Surprising finding: Old houses in dense areas don't offer discounts - they command premiums. 32.5% higher prices on average. This challenges the conventional wisdom. Dense areas aren't bargain hunting grounds; they're premium markets where renovated old properties fetch top dollar.</p>

                <h3>Speaker Notes - Slide 9:</h3>
                <p>Here's the complete strategy: Target properties 50+ years old in high-density areas. Renovate during off-peak months, sell during peak season. Conservative scenario yields $160K profit per property, optimal scenario yields $237K. It's that simple - and that profitable.</p>
